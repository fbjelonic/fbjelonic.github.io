## Background story

   I started learning [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) back in July 2019. The first tutorials are pretty basic. You start
installing ROS and the first tutorial tasks are to simply download and run pre-made ROS packages. One
of the first ones is the [turtesim](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlesim) simulator. Pretty basic and quite fun. It is a turtle, moving around in a colored plane. The normal task is to start two ROS nodes, the simulator and the [teleop-twist-keyboard](http://wiki.ros.org/teleop_twist_keyboard). Afterwards, you should be able to steer the little turtle around with your arrow keys. Then, the fun began. :smirk:

# Classical Snake game from 1976
## **Background Story:**
   It was the middle of the **second semester in Hong Kong** when I thought, it would be nice to **learn C++**. I had a lot of practice in MATLAB, but that was it. After I did the classical **"Hello World" in C++**, I challenged myself to code **Snake from scratch** (without any type of tutorial). I was not intereste in a nice GUI, so I decided a **terminal style snake** would suffice. **A day later, I was done.** After a couple of weeks, I also decided to get into **object oriented programming**. I read the [C++ Tutorial](https://www.learncpp.com/) from Alex and re-coded the **functional into an object oriented snake game**. By the way, his C++ tutorial is very comprehensive and . I highly recommend his website, if you are interested in learning C++.

**Robotics researcher working on agile legged robots and sim-to-real transfer.**

I am Filip Bjelonic, a roboticist based in Zurich.  
My work focuses on legged robots, high-performance locomotion, and robust pipelines that bridge the gap between simulation and real-world deployment — with a strong emphasis on learning-based control, system identification, and real-world experimentation.

This website serves as a living archive of my research, technical projects, and a few personal inspirations that shaped my path in robotics and beyond.

## What you can find here

### 📚 [Publications](/publications/)
A structured overview of my scientific work, including peer-reviewed journal papers, conference publications, preprints, and collaborative research contributions.

You will find:
- Abstracts and short summaries for each publication  
- Links to papers, PDFs, and BibTeX  
- Accompanying videos or project pages where available  
- Additional context beyond what fits into formal academic writing

This section reflects my ongoing work at the intersection of robotics, learning, and system design.

---

### 🐾 [Robots](/robots/)
A collection of robots I have worked with or helped bring to life — from quadrupeds to experimental platforms.

This includes:
- Technical descriptions of each robot platform
- Control approaches and lessons learned
- Real-world experiment highlights and performance showcases

Think of this as a behind-the-scenes tour through the machines that power my research.

---

### 🛠️ [Projects](/projects/)
A curated selection of applied and exploratory projects — ranging from full-scale research systems to side experiments.

Some projects are polished, others show the raw process of experimentation — both are intentional.

---

### 📄 [CV](/cv/)
A structured overview of my academic journey, research trajectory, and professional experience.

This page is intended for:
- Potential collaborators
- Students and researchers
- Industry partners
- Anyone interested in a deeper technical background

It provides a concise but complete snapshot of who I am professionally.

<!-- ### 🌍 [Favorite places](/places/)
A more personal section — a curated collection of places that inspire me, help me disconnect, or simply make life better.

This section will grow slowly and organically over time.

## 🚧 Work in progress

This website is intentionally evolving.  
I refine it whenever time allows — adding new research, improving documentation quality, and expanding sections with deeper insights, visuals, and interactive elements.

It is less a static portfolio and more a long-term archive of thinking, building, and exploration.

If you’re interested in collaboration, research, or just curious about legged robots — feel free to explore.

*More robots. More experiments. Less sim-to-real gap.*

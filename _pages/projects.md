# Self started projects

The following projects are ideas which came up randomly in my mind.
So I used up some of my free time to see how far I could come. Keep going to see
my results.

## 1. Autonomous Driller - autonomous car
### **Background Story:**
   

## 2. 2WD-ROSduino - remote controlled car
### **Background Story:**
   

## 3. Crazy Turtle - turtle simulation controller
### **Background Story:**
   I started learning [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) back in July 2019. The first tutorials are pretty basic. You start
installing ROS and the first tutorial tasks are to simply download and run pre-made ROS packages. One
of the first ones is the [turtesim](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlesim) simulator. Pretty basic and quite fun. It is a turtle, moving around in a colored plane. The normal task is to start two ROS nodes, the simulator and the [teleop-twist-keyboard](http://wiki.ros.org/teleop_twist_keyboard). Afterwards, you should be able to steer the little turtle around with your arrow keys. Then, the fun began. :smirk:

## 4. C-nake - classical Snake game from 1976
### **Background Story:**
   It was the middle of the **second semester in Hong Kong** when I thought, it would be nice to **learn C++**. I had a lot of practice in MATLAB, but that was it. After I did the classical **"Hello World" in C++**, I challenged myself to code **Snake from scratch** (without any type of tutorial). I was not intereste in a nice GUI, so I decided a **terminal style snake** would suffice. **A day later, I was done.** After a couple of weeks, I also decided to get into **object oriented programming**. I read the [C++ Tutorial](https://www.learncpp.com/) from Alex and re-coded the **functional into an object oriented snake game**. By the way, his C++ tutorial is very comprehensive and . I highly recommend his website, if you are interested in learning C++.

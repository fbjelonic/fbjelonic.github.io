title: "Spacehopper"
excerpt: "SpaceHopper is a small-scale three-legged hopping robot developed by students at ETH Zurich for future exploration of low-gravity environments like asteroids or small moons. It is designed to perform jumping locomotion with extended flight phases, using its legs for mid-air body reorientation.<br/><img src='/images/spacehopper.png'>"

In this project, I served as a supervisor, advising the student team on how to bridge the sim-to-real gap in their locomotion pipeline. I supported them in designing simulation setups that captured the robot’s dynamics, interpreting controller behavior, and planning safe real-world experiments. My role focused on guiding the students through the challenges of transferring their simulated hopping, flight-phase control, and landing strategies onto the physical robot, helping them achieve reliable performance under both Earth gravity off-loading and parabolic flight conditions.

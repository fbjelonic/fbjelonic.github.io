title: "Daisy"
excerpt: "Daisy builds on my torque-dense Tytan quadruped by mounting on top a dual-arm setup derived from the DynaArm from Duatic. With this hybrid design — a strong, agile four-legged base and two dexterous arms — Daisy serves as a versatile mobile manipulator capable of locomotion + manipulation in complex terrain and environments.<br/><img src='/images/daisy.jpeg'>"

I used Daisy to develop and train locomotion controllers capable of handling complex real-world conditions while carrying dual DynaArm manipulators. My policies focused on robust mobility over rough terrain, stairs, and uneven surfaces, while also learning to reject external disturbances generated by arm motion, payload shifts, or interaction forces from manipulation tasks.

Alongside the locomotion research, I helped debug and integrate the new mobile-manipulation setup — ensuring that the added arms and low-level control interfaces worked reliably with the quadruped base. Much of my work centered on stabilizing the combined system so Daisy could serve as a dependable platform for experiments involving simultaneous walking and manipulation.

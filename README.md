# 🚀 Filip Bjelonic — Personal Academic Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal academic website:  
👉 **https://filipbjelonic.com**

The site showcases my research in **legged robotics**, **reinforcement learning**, **sim-to-real transfer**, and my work on platforms such as **ANYmal**, **Tytan**, **Daisy**, **Minimal**, and supervisory projects like **SpaceHopper** and **Magnecko**.

It is built on top of the **Academic Pages** Jekyll theme and deployed via **GitHub Pages**.

<p>The following projects are ideas which came up in my mind which I want to solve.
So I used up some of my free time to see how far I could come. Scroll down to see
my results.</p>

<h3 id="crazy-turtle---turtle-simulation-controller">Crazy Turtle - Turtle Simulation Controller</h3>
<p><strong>Background Story:</strong>
I started learning <a href="https://www.ros.org/">ROS</a> back in July 2019. The first tutorials are pretty basic. You start
installing ROS and the first tutorial tasks are to simply download and run pre-made ROS packages. One
of the first ones is the <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/turtlesim">turtesim</a> simulator. Pretty basic
and quite fun. It is a turtle, moving around in a colored plane. The normal task is to 
start two ROS nodes, the simulator and the <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/teleop_twist_keyboard">teleop-twist-keyboard</a>. Afterwards, you should be 
able to steer the little turtle around with your arrow keys. Then, the fun began. :smirk:</p>
